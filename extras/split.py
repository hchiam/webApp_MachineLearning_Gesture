# This is a convenient python file
# to format the NN weights string ("wts" in gestures.js)
# to be 9 numbers per row (i.e. each matrix per timestamp, and each matrix has its own 3 rows printed along 1 row),
# with empty lines between each line.

# copy the wts string from gestures.html (in your browser) and put it between quotation marks here:
